If you are using container environments for testing then your may need NGINX to do some proxy to the local streams service since you may not be able to use http://localhost:5000 as a base_url inside another container since that just routes inside the container and not out.  More likely you have to use your http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5000 to be able to access the service-BUT the tapipy SDK only recognizes calls from localhost:5000 hosts as valid dev environments.  Hence the NGINX compose will allow you to routes https://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5001 requests to http://localhost:5000 for the streams dev service.  This is particulary useful if you are using the Tapis Jupyter container for testing.
